Usage: Click the Zoidberg icon and he'll eat (unload) all of your tabs. They stay open.


This extension unloads all of your tabs (in all windows) excluding the active
one. Similar to closing and re-opening Firefox with tab restoration.

Yet another method is going to about:unloads and clicking "Unloads" over and
over. That's all this extension does, really. Get all the tabs and unload them.

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(async () => {
  const tabs = await browser.tabs.query({ active: false });
  for (const tab of tabs) {
    await browser.tabs.discard(tab.id);
  }
});
